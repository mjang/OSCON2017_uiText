# Draft of Mike Jang's talk at OSCON, [scheduled May 11, 2017](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/57171).


## Talk Description, as published on the [OSCON 2017 Website](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/57171)

Web applications frequently have two audiences: end users (consumers) and administrators. End users don’t want to bother
with documentation, especially for “simple” tasks such as creating a new account. And while administrators may be more
understanding, they also don’t want to deal with documentation for everyday tasks. (They don’t want to refer to documentation
just to configure a new property, for example.) And they certainly don’t want to decipher a “self-documenting” developer
Java class. Meanwhile, many UI developers don’t have the skills needed to create awesome UI text.

Mike Jang explains that to keep your users happy, you need excellent UI text, also known as microcopy. Microcopy can save
time—and make the difference in selling an application. Mike shares the lessons he’s learned creating microcopy for a
new administrative and end-user web interface and discusses the stakeholders that he had to navigate in order to implement a microcopy style guide for a suite of web applications.
